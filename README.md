<h1>FritzBoxClient</h1>
<span>This simple client library logs in to your local FRITZ!Box using the provided password and URL (default: https://fritz.box) and provides access to a range of network management features, including retrieving all connected devices and more.</span>

<h2>What makes this wrapper special</h2>
<span>
    This wrapper does not use either the TR-064 or the AHA-HTTP interface. It uses the "proprietary" API of the Fritzbox. Due to the lack of official API documentation (as of 2024), I had to figure out the endpoints myself, test them, and implement them in the client.
</span>
<h2>FritzBoxAccessor usage</h2>
<span>This simple approach shows how to initialize the FritzBoxAccessor and get the devices from the FritzBox.</span>
<br/><br/>

```csharp
using FritzBoxClient;

using FritzBoxAccessor accessor = await FritzBoxAccessor.CreateAsync("password");
var devices = await accessor.GetAllConnectedDevciesInNetworkAsync();

foreach (var device in devices)
    Console.WriteLine($"Device: {device.Name}, Ip: {device.Ip}");

```

<span>Specify more details for the access:</span>
```csharp
FritzBoxAccessor fritzBoxAccessor = await FritzBoxAccessor.CreateAsync(fritzBoxPassword: "password", fritzBoxUrl: "https://192.168.178.1", userName: "fritz3000");
```
<br/>
<span>
    To change a device's internet access state, do the following:
</span>

```csharp
using FritzBoxClient;
using FritzBoxClient.Models;

using FritzBoxAccessor accessor = await FritzBoxAccessor.CreateAsync(fritzBoxPassword: "password");
var device = await accessor.GetSingleDeviceAsync(deviceName: "DESKTOP123");

await accessor.ChangeInternetAccessStateForDeviceAsync(device, InternetState.Blocked);

```
<h2>FritzBoxNasAccessor usage</h2>
<span>This simple approach shows how to initialize the FritzBoxNasAccessor and get the NAS storage disk information.</span>
<br/><br/>


```csharp
using FritzBoxClient;

using FritzBoxNasAccessor nasAccessor = await FritzBoxNasAccessor.CreateAsync(fritzBoxPassword: "password", fritzBoxUrl: "https://192.168.178.1");
var diskInformation = await nasAccessor.GetNasStorageDiskInfoAsync(path: "/Files/");

Console.WriteLine($"Total storage: {diskInformation.TotalInMb}Mb, free storage: {diskInformation.FreeInMb}Mb, used storage: {diskInformation.UsedInMb}Mb");****

```
<span>To get the bytes of a file, do the following:</span>
```csharp
byte[] fileBytes = await nasAccessor.GetNasFileBytes("/path/to/file.png");
```
