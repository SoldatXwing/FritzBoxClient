# FritzBoxClient

This simple client library logs in to your local FRITZ!Box using the provided password and URL (default: `https://fritz.box`) and provides access to a range of network management features, including retrieving all connected devices and more.

## What makes this wrapper special

This wrapper does not use either the TR-064 or the AHA-HTTP interface. It uses the "proprietary" API of the Fritzbox. Due to the lack of official API documentation (as of 2024), I had to figure out the endpoints myself, test them, and implement them in the client.

## FritzBoxAccessor Usage

This simple approach shows how to initialize the `FritzBoxAccessor` and get the devices from the FritzBox:

```csharp
using FritzBoxClient;

using FritzBoxAccessor accessor = await FritzBoxAccessor.CreateAsync("password");
var devices = await accessor.GetAllConnectedDevciesInNetworkAsync();

foreach (var device in devices)
    Console.WriteLine($"Device: {device.Name}, Ip: {device.Ip}");
```
Specify more details for the access:
```csharp
FritzBoxAccessor fritzBoxAccessor = await FritzBoxAccessor.CreateAsync(fritzBoxPassword: "password", fritzBoxUrl: "https://192.168.178.1", userName: "fritz3000");
```
To change a device's internet access state, do the following: 
```csharp
using FritzBoxClient;
using FritzBoxClient.Models;

using FritzBoxAccessor accessor = await FritzBoxAccessor.CreateAsync(fritzBoxPassword: "password");
var device = await accessor.GetSingleDeviceAsync(deviceName: "DESKTOP123");

await accessor.ChangeInternetAccessStateForDeviceAsync(device, InternetState.Blocked);
```
## FritzBoxNasAccessor usage
This simple approach shows how to initialize the FritzBoxNasAccessor and get the NAS storage disk information. 
```csharp
using FritzBoxClient;

using FritzBoxNasAccessor nasAccessor = await FritzBoxNasAccessor.CreateAsync(fritzBoxPassword: "password", fritzBoxUrl: "https://192.168.178.1");
var diskInformation = await nasAccessor.GetNasStorageDiskInfoAsync(path: "/Files/");

Console.WriteLine($"Total storage: {diskInformation.TotalInMb}Mb, free storage: {diskInformation.FreeInMb}Mb, used storage: {diskInformation.UsedInMb}Mb");
```
To get the bytes of a file, do the following:
```csharp
byte[] fileBytes = await nasAccessor.GetNasFileBytes("/path/to/file.png");
```
